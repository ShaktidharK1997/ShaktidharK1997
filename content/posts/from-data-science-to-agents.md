## Introduction

When I started my career as a data scientist, the job was primarily about building models — classification, regression, time series forecasting. Today, the landscape has shifted dramatically. In this post, I reflect on how the evolution from traditional ML to LLM-powered agents represents a natural progression for data scientists.

## The Traditional Data Science Workflow

The classic data science pipeline looks something like this:

1. Define the problem
2. Collect and clean data
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Deployment and monitoring

This workflow served us well for years. But it has a fundamental limitation: **each model solves exactly one narrow problem**.

## Enter Large Language Models

LLMs changed the game by providing general-purpose reasoning capabilities. Instead of training a separate model for each task, you can now:

- Describe the task in natural language
- Provide relevant context
- Get useful outputs across a wide range of problems

This doesn't replace traditional ML — there are still many problems where a well-tuned XGBoost model outperforms an LLM. But it opens up entirely new categories of applications.

## The Agent Layer

The real power comes when you combine LLMs with:

- **Tool use**: Let the model call APIs, query databases, execute code
- **Memory**: Maintain context across interactions
- **Planning**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps

This is what transforms an LLM from a text generator into an agent that can actually *do things*.

## Skills That Transfer

If you're a data scientist looking to move into agent development, you already have many of the key skills:

| Data Science Skill | Agent Development Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Feature engineering | Prompt engineering & context design |
| Model evaluation | Agent evaluation & benchmarking |
| Pipeline orchestration | Agent workflow design |
| A/B testing | Agent comparison & optimization |
| Data cleaning | Context curation & retrieval |

## Looking Forward

The line between "data scientist" and "AI engineer" is blurring. The most impactful practitioners will be those who can combine traditional ML rigor with the new capabilities that LLMs and agents provide.
